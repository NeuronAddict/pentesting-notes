# Lost checklist

* scan all with unicorn
* list all services and versions
* search for dependencies
* You're already lost, so take your time
* You don't have time to search vuln in a non custom application
* Know app -> know exploit
* If you have login form on known  app, search on the web defaults credentials!
* enumerate all before exploit. Are you sure you don't miss something? Can you verify if the exploit work BEFORE executing it?
* There are someway several versions of an exploit
* You can read by web traversal, can't you execute some file?
* for login, always try a cewl or think about context. The name of your target is not in all the seclist dictionnaries
* if an edb don't work, try google to find better exploit.
